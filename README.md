planner: Tries all the combinations, very slow and nearly impossible to run for (X,Y,Z) > 3

planner-genAlgo: Use a genetic algorithm to improve a population initialized from random values. Much much faster but not very accurate for huge reactors.

How to build: make all

How to run: <./bin/planner.bin or ./bin/planner-genAlgo.bin> <X size> <Y size> <Z size>
